Container Orchestration aims to handle the following responsibilities in production:
1. **Container Scheduling**  
   Determines the optimal placement of containers on available nodes based on resource requirements and constraints.
2. **Service Discovery & Load Balancing**  
   Routes traffic to the appropriate container instances, distributing workloads evenly across them.
3. **Scaling Management**  
   Automatically scales containerized applications up or down depending on defined metrics or usage patterns.
4. **Self-Healing**  
   Detects container failures and restarts, reschedules, or replaces them without manual intervention.
5. **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**  
   Deploys application updates in a controlled manner and can revert to previous versions in case of failure.
6. **Resource Allocation**  
   Manages compute resources by enforcing limits and requests for CPU and memory per container.
7. **Configuration Management**  
   Handles application configurations via environment variables, secrets, and config maps in a consistent way.
8. **Storage Orchestration**  
   Mounts and manages persistent storage volumes for stateful applications.
9. **Monitoring and Logging**  
   Collects logs and metrics from containers to support observability and debugging.
